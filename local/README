The settings.root and settings.nonroot files handle a few settings, notably
those for connecting to the database. Copy over the sample files in samples/
(renaming them so that they don't have the ".sample" extension), chmod/chown
the settings.root file so that it can only be read by root, and fill in the
credentials of the database users (one for the root MySQL user, one with
read-write access, and the other with read-only access). You'll need both files
for the various scripts.

    cp samples/settings.root settings.root
    cp samples/settings.nonroot settings.nonroot
    chown root:root settings.root
    chmod 0600 settings.root
