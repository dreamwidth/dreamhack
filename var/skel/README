Welcome to your Dreamhack installation!

This Dreamhack service is provided by Dreamwidth and is available
for general use. Preference will be given to those actively doing
development work, but please don't let the word 'development' stop you;
we have a healthy, nurturing community of people who are more than
willing to give their time in order to help out newcomers. (See the
'Community' section below for more details.)

(Notice for those who have read this README before: There have been
updates for the new server, and you may want to read it again. In
particular, you now need to connect to a different SSH server,
"ssh-hack.dreamwidth.net"; more details are below.)

Getting Started
===============

rahaeli has written a superb wiki page detailing how to get started with
your Dreamhack at the following address:

  http://wiki.dreamwidth.net/wiki/index.php/Dreamhack_Getting_Started

It covers most of the common things you'll need to do to get started. If
you have an issue, check this page first.

Connecting
==========

You will need an SSH client to connect to your Dreamhack. You'll be
using SSH to work with your Dreamhack for most things, including
creating patches, so it's worth getting to know how to use it.

  * Windows users can use PuTTY, from this URL:

      http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/

    You'll want to fill in the hostname as "ssh-hack.dreamwidth.net",
    then just click Connect. (Alternatively, save it as a stored session
    for later.)

  * Linux and Mac OS X users will generally already have OpenSSH, which
    will allow you to connect. You can do this from the terminal; type the
    following command (replacing 'dh-username' with your actual username):

      ssh dh-username@ssh-hack.dreamwidth.net

To connect, use the username/password combination from your
initial email. (If you're reading this from the email itself,
these details are above.) Please be aware that while your
Dreamhack URL is at "hack.dreamwidth.net", you will need to SSH to
"ssh-hack.dreamwidth.net".

The first time you connect, your client will tell you that it doesn't
have the host key in its cache. Check to make sure that the key
fingerprint it lists is the same as any one of the lines below, and
if so, feel free to continue. (Generally this will involve clicking
or typing "Yes" at the prompt.) If the host key doesn't match, please
contact Mark at <mark@dreamwidth.org>.

  * ECDSA:
      SHA256: TAtO07wp/zu1L4lIoYPnJh9pficQUcBsl9aqZiEM6UE
         MD5: 73:10:37:bc:47:4b:24:dc:50:5f:7e:af:f7:b4:a0:b6

  * RSA:
      SHA256: jU9iFXflDW/FMRAFDaR0HMZ3zwsNxBa333A4Pl7ys1w
         MD5: 29:18:e9:63:c5:b5:79:5c:bd:d6:3b:63:ce:7a:83:85

  * ED25519:
      SHA256: mxpvqf1GWXHNpcnyPFXFJ0OcdqcIDlXlpT/Za/2i1Fg
         MD5: fd:76:e0:33:91:8f:e2:5d:7f:3f:b6:a3:e4:75:a3:18

When you log in for the first time, you will be reminded to create
the password for the 'system' user. This can be done by running the
following command:

    $LJHOME/bin/upgrading/make_system.pl

It is also recommended that on login you change your password to
something more easily memorable by using the "passwd" command.

Maintenance
===========

The Dreamhack installation that is installed is up-to-date at the time
of setup, but if you wish to keep it up-to-date you will need to do so
yourself. Instructions on doing so can be found at:

  http://wiki.dreamwidth.net/wiki/index.php/Dev_Maintenance

Although your Dreamhack is ready to run, you may be interested in
editing the $LJHOME/ext/local/etc/config-local.pl file in order to
further customize the options available.

You can start and stop your Apache instance using the commands
"start-apache" and "stop-apache". Although the initial setup will give
you a working Apache instance, it will not bring it up automatically,
so you will need to use "start-apache" to do so. (In the past, Apache
instances were automatically brought up; this has changed due to memory
considerations.)

Please note that if the host machine is rebooted, Dreamhack
installations on the server will not be brought back up automatically.
In addition, if you do not foresee using your Dreamhack for a period of
time, please bring it down with the "stop-apache" command.

Submitting your Changes
=======================

Once you've made changes to the code, you can submit them for review by
making a pull request on GitHub. Your Dreamhack has already been set up
with your `dreamwidth` fork set as the origin, so you simply need
to push your changes and then hop onto the GitHub website and send a
pull request.

The process for doing this can be found on the wiki:

  http://wiki.dreamwidth.net/wiki/index.php/Version_Control

Note that you will need a Contributor Licensing Agreement (CLA) on file
with Dreamwidth Studios, LLC before your changes can be accepted into
the codebase. More information on CLAs can be found on the wiki:

  http://wiki.dreamwidth.net/wiki/index.php/Contributor_Licensing_Agreement

Community
=========

There is a thriving community of Dreamwidth pioneers, including coders,
designers, testers, and others; most of us live in Discord. If you have
a query or concern, you can often get an answer in real-time there! To
join, please follow this link:

  https://discord.gg/dreamwidth

Once you have joined, say hello in the #introductions channel and one of
our staff will get you in to see all the other channels.

We also have two development communities on Dreamwidth:

  * http://dw-dev.dreamwidth.org/profile

      This community is for general discussion on Dreamwidth development.

  * http://dw-dev-training.dreamwidth.org/profile

      This community is focused more on helpful tips on working with
      Dreamwidth code, or even coding in general. You'll probably find
      something here even if you're an experienced coder, so do take a
      look.

Please feel free to join us!

Dreamhack Structure
===================

The following is an explanation of the files/directories you will find in your
home directory:

  * apache/

      This directory contains your Apache configuration and log files.

      By default, the Apache configuration simply defines a few
      environment variables for your particular Dreamhack account (in
      the conf/envvars file) and then uses a generic Apache config
      tailored for Dreamhacks; among other things, this means that you
      will generally never need to update your Apache config as updates
      to the generic one will be able to take effect.

      You will likely never have to change your Apache configuration,
      but if you find it to be necessary, please reach out to us on
      Discord or in the dw_dev community. If you need to make changes,
      we might need to make them to the default configuration for
      others!

  * bin/

      This directory is the first entry in your PATH environment
      variable, and contains the following scripts:

        * start-apache - starts your Apache instance.
        * stop-apache  - stops your Apache instance.

      If you need more scripts in your PATH, this is the place to add
      them. A selection of scripts can be found at:

        http://wiki.dreamwidth.net/wiki/index.php/Dev_Maintenance#Scripting

  * dw/

      This is where your Dreamhack installation lives, and is the target
      of the LJHOME environment variable - so this is where you'll be
      spending most of your time. ;)

  * crontab-import

      This file contains a sample crontab which you may import if you
      need to. Instructions on doing so are contained in the file.

  * .gitconfig

      This file (which is hidden by default because of the dot at
      the start of its name) is how you can configure git. On a new
      install, the 'name' and 'email' fields are already filled in by
      the automatic installer; you can change these if you wish your
      changes to be credited to another name or email address.

Epilogue
========

Hopefully, this should be all the information you need to get started.
Should you need any more information, please reach out to us on Discord
or in the dw_dev community!
