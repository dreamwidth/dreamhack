If you are a Dreamhack user trying to stop or start Apache, please note that
using sudo is not the correct way to do it on a Dreamhack!

  * Where the instructions say to execute:
      sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 stop

    You should instead execute:
      stop-apache

  * Similarly, where the instructions say to execute:
      sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 start

    You should instead execute:
      start-apache

The instructions are written assuming a 'normal' installation of Dreamwidth,
so they are incorrect on a Dreamhack.

You can press Ctrl-C at this point to exit out of sudo, if you wish.
