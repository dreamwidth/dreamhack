Welcome to the NEW Dreamhack server, newhack.dreamwidth.net!

Dreamhack users on this system are by default given a quota of 500MB.
This should be plenty even for two Dreamhack installations, but if you
find you need more, feel free to send Sophie an email at
<sophie@hack.dreamwidth.org>, or find her on IRC:
  http://wiki.dwscoalition.org/notes/IRC

For more information on the service, please review the README
file in your home directory.
