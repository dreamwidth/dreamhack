          <h1>Why do you need a GitHub username?</h1>
          <p>As Dreamwidth is a free/open-source project, we need somewhere to put the source code
          so that other people (you!) can work with it. We've chosen to use <a
          href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> for this, in line with most current projects like
          ours.</p>

          <p>As we use GitHub's issue tracker for submitting changes to the source code, we've found
          that it's easiest for everybody if developers wanting to make changes to the code have a
          GitHub account, and have the main repository - <strong><a
          href="https://github.com/dreamwidth/dreamwidth/">dreamwidth</a></strong> - "forked".
          (Forking a repository on GitHub means that you have your own copy of the code to work
          with.)</p>

          <p>Forking the two repositories is easy. First, <a href="https://github.com/join">sign up
          for a free GitHub account</a> (if you don't already have one). Then, follow each of the
          two repository links in the previous paragraph and, for each one, click the "Fork" button
          in the header at the top right, next to the "Watch" (or "Unwatch") and "Star" buttons:</p>

	  <p><img class="explanatory-image" id="fork-location" src="github-fork-location.png" width="455" height="181" alt="An
image of the GitHub user interface, cropped to the top-right corner of a
repository page. The top header bar shows a 'Gist' link at the top-left of the
cropped image, and in the top-right are: a bell icon with a blue circle, a plus
sign with a down arrow next to it, and a user picture with a down arrow next to
it. Below these are three buttons with numbers next to them: 'Unwatch', 'Star'
and 'Fork'. The 'Fork' button is circled in red."></p>

          <p>After doing this for <strong>dreamwidth</strong>, you
          will have your own copy of the code and can apply for a Dreamhack by <a
          href="/apply.shtml">using the application form</a>. As part of the Dreamhack setup
          process, we'll download your copy of the code and set it up in your own area, so that you
          can work on the code safely.</p>

          <p>That's pretty much it! If you're ready to continue and have a GitHub account with both
          repositories forked, you can <strong><a href="/apply.shtml">move on to the application
          form</a></strong>. If you still need help, go ahead and submit an application anyway; I'll
          get in touch and answer any questions you may have or help you with whatever you need.</p>
