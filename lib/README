The scripts `dreamhacks-db*.pl` handle connecting to the database. Copy over
the sample file, and fill in the credentials of the database users (one with
read-write access, the other with read-only access). You'll need both files
for the various scripts.

    cp dreamhacks-db.pl.txt dreamhacks-db.pl
    cp dreamhacks-db.pl.txt dreamhacks-db-readonly.pl
