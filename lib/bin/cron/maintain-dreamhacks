Your SSH password is the same as it was before the rebuild, so you should be
able to log in with the same credentials. The database password has changed,
however, so you should take note of the new value in your etc/config-private.pl
file in case you need it.

A request to reinstall your Dreamhack has been received.

Within the next 60 seconds, you can cancel this request with the following

rm $filename

If the reinstall continues, you will be logged out and your account will be
completely rebuilt from scratch - that is, your account and home directory will
be deleted and reinstalled as if for a new user. Your password (and your
~/.ssh/authorized_keys file, if any) will be copied over, and you will receive
an email once the reinstall is complete, which will take about 2-3 minutes.
Your Apache instance will also be automatically started.

If you have any data you need to backup, please CANCEL this request and do so

Your account has been sent to the new server, which will now set the account up
on its end. You will receive another email when this process is complete.

You can still log into the old server if you want to do so, but note that you
will not be able to use Apache on the old server any more as the Web access has
been set up to point to the new server, and you will lose any changes made on
the old server when it is taken down. To assist with this, a file named
'THIS_IS_THE_OLD_SERVER.txt' has been placed in your home directory, so you can
use this to see if you are on the old server.

Please wait for an email from the new server. If you do not receive one within
the next 15 minutes, please reply to this email and let Sophie know. Thank you!

A request to migrate your Dreamhack to the new server has been received. Thank
you!

If you are not ready to migrate yet, you can cancel this request with the
following command within the next 60 seconds:

rm $filename

If the migration continues, you will be logged out, your Apache will be
stopped, and your account will be sent to the new server at
"newhack.dreamwidth.net". You will receive an email when the account has been
transferred, and another one from the new server when it has been set up.

All your data will be transferred, and in case of any problems, your account on
the old server will also remain active, although you will be unable to use
Apache with it. Should any problems occur during migration, an error report
will be sent to Sophie and you should receive an email from her. (If you don't,
feel free to email her yourself at <sophie\@hack.dreamwidth.net>.)

Hello $config{'preferred_name'},

Unfortunately, the migration of your Dreamhack appears to have failed. An error
report has been sent to Sophie, who will try to work things out and contact you
with more information.

Sorry for the inconvenience! She did test the scripts before making them
available, but obviously something has gone wrong that she didn't expect. If
you don't hear from her soon - in the next 12 hours or so - please email her at
<sophie\@hack.dreamwidth.net> (or reply to this email) and let her know about
this problem, as she may have missed the email.

Unfortunately, due to the way the migration works, you will probably not be
able to do any more testing with Apache until the problem is fixed, even on the
old server. Please hang in there! We'll get this sorted.

[this is an automatic message]

Hello $config{'preferred_name'},

Your migration has completed successfully and you should now be able to log in
via SSH on the new server:

Hostname: newhack.dreamwidth.net
Username: $config{'ssh_username'}
Password: <the same password you had before>

You should also use the new server name in your SFTP program, if you use one.
The old server at 'hack.dreamwidth.net' can no longer be logged into for now,
but stay tuned to your email - I plan to point the old name to the new server
soon. In the meantime, you should use the server name 'newhack.dreamwidth.net'
instead.

Note that the URL you use for your Dreamhack will remain the same:

http://www.$config{'domain'}/

If you need anything, or have any problems, let me know by replying to this
message. It's possible that there are some programs missing on the new server
because I forgot to install them. If this is the case, just let me know and
I'll get it on for you as soon as possible.

Thank you, and take care!

 - Sophie.
