<h1>xb95's API Caching Service</h1>

<p>This is a very simple, easy to use API caching proxy.  Use it just like you use CCP's API, except instead
of connecting to <tt>api.eve-online.com</tt>, you instead connect to <tt>api.eve-dev.com</tt>.  For example:</p>

<p><a href="http://api.eve-dev.com/eve/CharacterID.xml.aspx?names=Shaina">http://api.eve-dev.com/eve/CharacterID.xml.aspx?names=Shaina</a></p>

<p>The above URL gives you output that is <em>exactly</em> what CCP gives you, except it is cached by my
server.  You can refresh it as much as you'd like, and you will never get the dreaded "wallet exhausted" error
that we all know so well.</p>

<p>GET and POST are both supported.  Currently, the caching proxy does <em>not</em> update the currentTime
value in the XML returned.  If this is a problem for you, let me know.</p>

<h2>Security</h2>

<p>If you know who I am ... great, you are safe.  If you don't, I welcome you to go ask around about me (Mark Smith,
I go by xb95 on Coldfront IRC, and you can contact Shaina in EVE).  Talk to Chribba, or Entity, or Salvis, or
LaVista, or ...</p>

<p>Any data that goes through a caching proxy is, by the nature of the service, cached.  I will not use your data,
redistribute it, or give anybody access to it.  Nobody has access to this server except for me, and I will secure
your data like my own.</p>

<h2>Contact</h2>

<p>If you want to get in touch with me, you can email me (mark at dreamwidth.org), contact me in EVE (Shaina), or
find me on Coldfront IRC (xb95).</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
